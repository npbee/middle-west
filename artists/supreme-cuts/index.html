bio:
    - paragraph: <p>Supreme Cuts -- Mike Perry & Austin Keultjes -- are scholars of every genre they borrow from.  Leaning heavily on the ideals and aesthetics of modern rap and its sub-genres, especially Footwork, they cast a wide net into the sub-bass heavy recesses of DatPiff and YouTube and skim the cream from the top.</p>

    - paragraph: <p>The resulting downtempo beat-compositions are buoyant, urgent, vicious things, yet they remain foetid with all the funk of a Bangladesh beat turned-velour and then screwed into oblivion.  Obsessives about the ghetto house of DJ Funk and the angular work of Philip Glass, Perry & Keultjes produce a gripping future music of lilting polyrhythms and narrative complexity that is impossible to peel the film of THC and sweat from.</p>


    - paragraph: <p>Supreme Cuts' collaborations with Main Attrakionz, How to Dress Well, Wise Blood, Haleek Maul, Holy Other and more have contributed to a growing reputation, rapport and cred in the indie world, but usurping those who currently occupy the beatmaking throne is their end-goal.  On Whispers in the Dark they plumb the depths of their influences and slowly exhale a wisely-chosen reconstitution of all that has been great about electronic music for the past 40 years.</p>
